# supply_chain_analytics
This repository contains files used in building Machine Learning models for an instant noodles company, aiming to optimize supply chain quantities, analyze demand patterns across the country, and drive targeted advertising strategies to strengthen the bottom line.<br>
The coding language used here is Python Programing.

## DataSet:
- Data.csv

## Code File: (.ipynb)
- code_file.ipynb

## Business Report & Presentation: (.pdf)
- The submitted Business report helps the company wants in optimizing the supply quantity in each warehouse by determining the optimum weight of the product to be shipped each time to the warehouse. Also, an analysis of demand pattern in different pockets of the country is presented to aid the company in targeted advertisement campaigning, therefore help boost sales and increase the bottom line.<br>

- The presentation outlines a detailed approach that was undertaken, covering the following aspects:<br>
  > Data cleaning <br>
  
  > Exploratory analysis & Impactful Visualizations <br>
  
  > Feature transformation & selection<br>
  
  > Model Building & Fine tuning <br>
  
  > Model Evaluation & Business Recommendations

## How to run the code?
- Fork & Clone the repository
- Install the above libraries (virtual environment recommended) if not available using the command `pip install` in terminal
- Open the Code file and run all the cells. (Same Folder hierarchy as in repository to be used)
